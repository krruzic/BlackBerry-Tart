A simpler way to setup BlackBerry-py's Tart.

Install with
`pip install bbtart/`


Requires PIL/Pillow


You'll need to move the tart.sh and ini files OUT of this directory and into your
'workspace' to use them.

This may have been a waste of my time, but it was fun setting up and makes future installs A LOT easier.
